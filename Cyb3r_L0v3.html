      <p align = "center">Gosh, 20 parts seem too much<br/>I will be able to empty myself completely<br/>the reason is simple, it's your midas' touch<br/>made the time out of this world, heavenly</p>
      <p align = "center">before, young zaki had goals and dreams<br/>he thought that he doesn't need love or affection<br/>then he realized, he needed to switch teams<br/>that was after he met a girl better than perfection</p>
      <p align = "center">young zaki thought love isn't that important<br/>he always was proud of himself and thought he was better alone<br/>but after god sent him an angle, he is willing to go to a serpent nest<br/>to make her a necklace with a big ass gemstone</p>
      <p align = "center">The following lines are nothing but reality<br/>They may seem too good to be true<br/>you're more precious than a full coral sea<br/>it's your name or face that i would put in a tattoo</p>
      <p align = "center">Your face....has awoken my deepest fantasies<br/>made me day dream of you all the time<br/>look, Just look at all these homes and families<br/>I promise ous will be just like this poem, it will rhyme</p>
      <p align = "center">a level 120 mage<br/>charmed a fury warrior<br/>but wait, is magic still used at this day and age?<br/>of course it is, and oh boy it's glorious</p>
      <p align = "center">such a tender laugh from one of the holy beings<br/>cures all sadness and depression<br/>It awoken this humble man's feelings<br/>now time for this man to fulfill the protection mission</p>
      <p align = "center">You're that special algorithm that made an outstanding program<br/>even the most brilliant hackers out there can't decode it's core<br/>but to me, you opened up that dam<br/>and left this computer maniac seeking more</p>
      <p align = "center">the core, as soft as a kitten<br/>the shell, as cute as puppy<br/>i met you, then i found out that my heart was bitten<br/>now, i will respond your call even if i was as dead as a mummy</p>
      <p align = "center">it is said, never judge a book by it's cover<br/>i ignored that, and i went ahead and judged you<br/>i thought in myself, she is perfect, i wish she was my lover<br/>i will embrace her even if she has simian flu</p>
      <p align = "center">Hurry! my battery is low i need a charger!<br/>my feelings are decaying and only you can rebuild them<br/>you always underestimate yourself, but trust me you're a charmer<br/>i am at your disposal, i will dive deep into the sea for you to enjoy some clam</p>
      <p align = "center">it is amazing how you actually like someone like me<br/>i don't have the body nor the paper nor the brain<br/>but this is your choice, and i respect thee<br/>i promise i will be the best for you, even if it means absolute pain</p>
      <p align = "center">maths cannot calculate how much love i hold for you<br/>in maths, infinity is the biggest value<br/>it's simple my love is big too<br/>but my love >> infinity and you better believe it because it's true</p>
      <p align = "center">life played a dirty trick on us<br/>why until now we had to meet?<br/>ugh fuck it, no need to dwell on the past, we met and that's a plus<br/>and together we will obliterate life, we will hit that YEET</p>
      <p align = "center">Is your dad a terrorist?<br/>because the bomb he is protecting is one of a kind<br/>can't wait to come out of this mist<br/>and bring the ring that will indeed bind</p>
      <p align = "center">the fear of betrayal is present in each heart<br/>you showed boundless trust from the first month<br/>i was astonished, it hit my heart like a dart<br/>no matter how long i will wait, i will be with you and move forth</p>
      <p align = "center">just close your eyes for a sec and imagine<br/>imagine being together, hugging tightly, breathing heavily<br/>these imaginations are the cure sadness of mine<br/>i don't believe in fairy tales, but this one is wil happen, truely</p>
      <p align = "center">rick ross braging about all the bitches he got<br/>honestly i pity him<br/>although he has insane amounts of money and pot<br/>sooner or later, he will become extremly dim</p>
      <p align = "center">well even though this poem is coming to an end<br/>i will always have more emotions deep inside me for you<br/>i consider you the second half of my soul and can't be shattered not even with a rend <br/>i share immense love for you, i hope you do too</p>
      <p align = "center">i hope you like what has been said here<br/>i tried to be as sweet and soft as the soap dove<br/>but we are limited, next time you will need to be next to me and hear<br/>i won't go down easily, i will die, i will dedicate my life for this, this Cyb3r_L0v3</p>
