      <p align = "center">It's true, most of the time we jest <br/>But i know deep down you feel messed <br/>To me, you opened your chest <br/> And for the love of god, stop thinking that you're a pest <br/>I will sacrifice anything because making you happy is my quest <br/>And i will torture myself if i ever find out you are depressed <br/>You're like the X mark, hiding the treasure chest<br/>Or maybe the loot hidden deep down the monster nest<br/>Eitherway you may have guessed<br/> That, indeed, you are the best<br/> And from god, you were blessed</p>
