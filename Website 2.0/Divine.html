      <p align = "center">You were able to, in my heart, reign<br/>You turned this little fella insane<br/>He found out that you're more important than what he pumps through veins<br/>Because the brain had all bad emotions slain</p>
      <p align = "center">Like you, people are as sweet as a fruit<br/>Having such tender voice even more tender than a lute<br/>I would walk an endless route<br/>And get by your side because the happiness you cause is absolute</p>
      <p align = "center">I'm like a pirate and you're the treasure<br/>You are the top choice of leisure<br/>I'd look at you even if you cause seisures<br/>Because honestly, everything related to you is considered pleasure</p>
      <p align = "center">A solar eclipse, what a beautiful sight<br/>But it trembles in fear when it stands next to you might<br/>You would shatter it with a smile<br/>Well i'm dumb, you cannot compare the king to a knight</p>
      <p align = "center">My feelings for you witnessed a huge thrive<br/>If i empty my feelings in a hard drive<br/>They would overloadit and it won't survive<br/>If it's for you, in the mariana trench i would dive</p>
      <p align = "center">Your punch to my heart is stronger than Ak-47<br/>You made my feelings grow faster than the soviet union with stalin<br/>When i see you i might crumble like the towers in the 9/11<br/>But that won't matter, i'll be going to heaven</p>
      <p align = "center">You got engraved in my heart like a tattoo<br/>Honestly, all i want in my life is you<br/>Maybe your presence upsets a few<br/>But me, i wouldsacrifice anything to enjoy your view</p>
      <p align = "center">Lately i feel like i'm reborn<br/>I used to feel all lonely and sad and torn<br/>But you were like that viking warhorn<br/>Now i became a man with no bourne</p>
      <p align = "center">This might sound weird, but i wish we could cuddle<br/>I don't care where even in a mud puddle<br/>Thinking about such beautiful and perfect actions makes me fuddle<br/>I would still hold my promises even if it's a muddle</p>
      <p align = "center">My life is like a body and you're the spine<br/>I will do ANYTHING so you can be mine<br/>Honestly you deserve a shrine<br/>Because the love i hold for you is divine</p>
