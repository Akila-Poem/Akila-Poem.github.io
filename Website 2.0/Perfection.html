      <p align = "center">Some people's presence is like honey<br/>For some it's annoying like a furry<br/>But yours is considered heavenly<br/>I would stay with you years and years willingly</p>
      <p align = "center">I'm so lucky having you by my side<br/>It feels like i'm in a ferrari ride<br/>The people who said bad stuff about you lied<br/>They felt so jealous which means they are denied</p>
      <p align = "center">Never tought i'd find such a pearl<br/>Hidden deep in a terrifying swirl<br/>The ocean mangles intruders in a curl<br/>That shows that you are the best girl</p>
      <p align = "center">Seeked love out there<br/>I basicly found my soul bare<br/>You showed up like a flare<br/>I just had to rush to you like a mare</p>
      <p align = "center">Idiots tried domination<br/>But little do they know that you're out of a narration<br/>I will roll with affection<br/>After all we here are talking about perfection</p>

    <!--You found the 1st part :) -->
    <!-- Before i met you i didn't realize that my life was filled with sorrow-->
    <!-- It had no light, it was a burrow -->
    <!-- but life is full of turns, everything changed in a tomorrow -->
    <!-- i met you and for you i'm willing to climb mount kilimanjaro -->
