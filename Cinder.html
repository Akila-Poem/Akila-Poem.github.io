      <p align = "center">Jesus christ is this reality?<br/>life was entangled in a chain, you were the key<br/>all sorts of jewels could be found under the sea<br/>I dove down, found you, found a ruby</p>
      <p align = "center">sweet, cute, and breathtaking<br/>no other things could be said, except, otherworldly<br/>you accepted me, the way i am, gladly<br/>you got my heart forever, plus my loyalty</p>
      <p align = "center">if i ever treat you wrong, know it's a bluff<br/>i never mean, NEVER,with you, to be rough<br/>you cought my heart with handcuffs<br/>and i accept it completely, because you're hot stuff</p>
      <p align = "center">they say that god created 4 things with his own hands<br/>i'm sure you're one of them this is why i'm making plans<br/>surely, you got followers, i surpass all your fans<br/>hurry up! let's go up in our mercedes-benz</p>
      <p align = "center">your smile, the smile that makes me bow down<br/>here ya go! the best future gf's crown!<br/>i'm in this big country, looking for you town after town<br/>i could be your beast when you want, or be your clown</p>
      <p align = "center">i admire you more than egyptians admire Mo Salah<br/>I pray night and to have you, Please Allah<br/>let's fight together life, and die in valhalla<br/>knock knock, it's yo boi salah salah</p>
      <p align = "center">strong, hard, solid, just like a piece of timber<br/>there is a water bender, air bender, you are the love bender<br/>one day i will capture that ring finger<br/>together we are the wood, let's burn together and turn into cinder</p>
