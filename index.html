      <p align = "center">Those who made you bleed <br/> Thinking they are as strong as a stead <br/> Just feel happy, from them you're freed <br/>And god's judgment won't be sweet </p>
      <p align = "center"> You're care for others is vast <br/> And your love will forever last <br/> Was it a spell that you did cast? <br/> Because i loved you so much, and fast </p>
      <p align = "center"> The cuteness meter breaks when it sees your face <br/> You and beauty are connected tightly with a lace <br/> When i saw you, i felt like getting hit with a mace<br/>How lucky should one be to meet the best one in human race?</p>
      <p align = "center"> Angelic voice with no halo floating<br/>Just having it in my ear is mesmerizing<br/>Hope, determination, love, this voice keeps bringing<br/>It's not enough thanking god day and night for this blessing</p>
      <p align = "center"> Personality like nothing else <br/> In that kind heart nothing is false <br/> Only a pure and clean sense <br/> I would fight all my life because your heart is immense </p>
      <p align = "center"> Having you is more like a dream <br/> It's not everyday that you see someone that has steam <br/> You make me laugh even harder than a meme <br/> You are more important than a cake's top cream</p>
      <p align = "center"> Everyone's core is made of lead <br/> Yours is made of gold and that cannot be spread <br/> I know for a fact that when we meet i will be red <br/>Because...i got hit with a cupid's arrow head</p>
      <p align = "center"> <strong>To:</strong>The best person alive <3 <br/> <strong>From:</strong> Secret admirer</p>
