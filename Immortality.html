      <p align = "center">Let's say this poem is....different<br/>All the last ones were written....let's say passively<br/>Just for the fact that you're magnificent<br/>I will write this one and express myself romanticly</p>
      <p align = "center">I cannot wait anymore....i just can't<br/>I want to feel your warm breath on my neck<br/>I hope the access to your heart you will grant<br/>My love for you turned whole after being just a fleck</p>
      <p align = "center">I fell into your charm harder than an avalanche<br/>Honestly....i'd stay down as long as i got you<br/>I tried....but these feelings are too strong to stanch<br/>It's all good don't worry, this love will be forever true</p>
      <p align = "center">You succeeded, you invaded my mind<br/>And now i truely became obsessed<br/>I'm willing to follow you evn if you're blind<br/>After all, you always succeed in making me feel true zest</p>
      <p align = "center">I will dedicate my life to strike for your honor<br/>I will eradicate any excuse of a human that shows disrespect<br/>The unlucky one needs to consider himself as a goner<br/>I should never stay shut for what's perfect</p>
      <p align = "center">So please consider this...<br/>I got linked with you, which woke upmy emotionality<br/>Those emotions....i really don't wanna dismiss<br/>I just want me, and you together and achieve immortality</p>
